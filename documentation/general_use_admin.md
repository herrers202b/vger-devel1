# General Use Guide - Admin
General usage guide for the VGER online readiness system dream team. Within this guide you will find several objects to create such as:
- Surveys: a collection of categories and questions for students and faculty to fill out.
- Categories: a subset of survey, these are as the name suggests, a category or grouping of like questions.
- Questions: the actual questions that will make up a specific survey.
- Option Group, also called "range" is a grouping of choices(option_choices) that students can select for an answer. There are three main option groups as of 5/17/2021: True/False, Text, and Range(multiple choice). Ranges can be customized using the "view ranges" button from the "Surveys" page. Here you can name the range and set the title of the weights in order from 0-4.

### Option Groups and Choices:
These allow us to create a custom question format. Since you as an admin are creating the survey it is designed such that you will know the format of your questions. We have placed these options at the bottom of the Survey List page. Before creating a survey it is recommended to follow the button prompt for "Vew Ranges" and create the choices(ranges) for the different questions you will be asking students.
