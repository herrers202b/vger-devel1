    <h1>Welcome to the Remote Learning Survey!</h1>

    <p>Our mission is to provide the students of SUNY Potsdam with a survey to help them determine what style of learning is best for them in the upcoming years of uncertainty. Part of our goal is to also allow the acedemic advisors of SUNY Potsdam to be part of the process in finding what works best for them.</p>

    <p><em>Answer a series of questions to help determine which situation suits you best!</em></p>
